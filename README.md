# BTreeDictionary
A CLI tool for a simple key-value database. Implemented, using a B-Tree to ensure the efficiency of operations.  
The main operations are: 
- set *key* *value*
- get *key*
Also supports transactions. 

# TODO 
- Split code in different modules
- Add tests
- Make the write to file of the root reference fault-tolerant
